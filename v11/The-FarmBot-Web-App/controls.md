You generally will not need to manually control FarmBot, but in case you want to show off to your friends, you can do so from the **controls** panel. Here, you'll find buttons for [movement](../The-FarmBot-Web-App/controls/move.md), toggles and sliders for [controlling peripherals](../The-FarmBot-Web-App/controls/peripherals.md), and an area for [watching a livestream of your FarmBot](../The-FarmBot-Web-App/controls/webcam-feeds.md).
