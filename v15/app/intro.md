The **FarmBot web app** is a web-based application that allows you to control and configure your FarmBot from any desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone.

{% include youtube.html id="0EAcUbO6tqo" %}

Because the app is web-based, you will never need to install it, and every time you load the app, you will have the latest features and security updates. The core features include the:

:seedling: [Farm designer](farm-designer.md) for drag and drop designing of your garden layout

:calendar: [Event scheduler](events.md) for telling FarmBot when to water the garden and perform other operations

:page_facing_up: [Sequence editor](sequences.md) allowing you to program how FarmBot operates without writing any code

:registered: [Regimen editor](regimens.md) for scheduling sequences based on plant age

:video_game: [Controls](controls.md) for moving FarmBot in real-time and operating its peripherals and sensors

:wrench: Management of FarmBot's [tools and seed containers](tools.md)

:1234: Management of [FarmBot's settings](settings.md)

:pager: Storage and viewing of [logs](intro/logs.md) and sensor readings

# Forever free

We expect to indefinitely offer **free usage** of the [my.farm.bot](https://my.farm.bot) web app service adequate for home growing needs (people)(community)

While we do not currently have any paid plans, in the future we may charge for:

* Commercial or industrial use
* FarmBots larger than 3m x 6m in area
* FarmBots growing large numbers of plants concurrently
* Multi-bot/multi-user management
* Advanced features
* Increased account limits

Because the web app software is [100% open-source](http://licensing.farm.bot) (products), you can always host it on your own server if you do not want to use our service or if it is inadequate for your needs.
