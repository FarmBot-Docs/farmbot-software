content="Send us an email at [contact@farm.bot](mailto:contact@farm.bot) with a link to your [publicly shared sequence](../sequences/shared-sequences.md#publishing) and a brief description of why you think your sequence should be featured. We'll review the contents of the sequence and let you know if we've decided to feature it!

The best candidates are sequences that provide value to a broad set of FarmBot users, are easy to understand and use, and give FarmBot new capabilities that most users aren't likely benefitting from otherwise."
