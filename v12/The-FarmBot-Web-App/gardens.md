The **gardens** feature allows you to save a garden (all of the plants and their locations) for re-use at a later time. This can be especially useful if you want to have different gardens for each season.

# Save a garden
To save the current garden, first navigate to the **gardens** panel and click the <span class="fb-button fb-blue"><i class='fa fa-plus'></i></span> button.

Enter a **NAME** and click <span class="fb-button fb-gray">Snapshot current garden</span>. A copy of the garden will then be saved and shown in the list of gardens.

# View and edit gardens
Navigate to the **gardens** panel and select a garden.

This will load the garden into the map allowing you to view it, as well as add, re-locate, and delete plants from the garden. The map background will be displayed gray to indicate a saved garden (rather than the current garden) is being displayed and edited.

Once you are finished viewing and editing, click the <span class="fb-button fb-gray">Exit</span> button located in the saved gardens panel, or the <span class="fb-button fb-red">Exit</span> button located in the **VIEWING SAVED GARDEN** menu at the top of the map area.

# Applying a garden
If you are ready to use one of your gardens, you must **apply** it to an empty map. First, delete all plants from the current garden (the one that is shown when you load the app). You can do this quickly by using the [multi-select mode](farm-designer.md#select-mode) and <span class="fb-button fb-gray">Select all</span> button.

Once the current map is empty, navigate to the gardens panel, select a garden, and click <span class="fb-button fb-green">Apply</span>.
