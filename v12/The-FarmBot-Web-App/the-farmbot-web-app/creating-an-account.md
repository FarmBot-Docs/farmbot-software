# Choose your FarmBot
Clicking the email verification link will log you into the app and take you to the [message center](message-center.md). Here, you'll see a few messages to help you become familiar with the app, as well as one to **Choose your FarmBot**.

Once you let the app know which FarmBot model you have, it will add a set of resources (peripherals, sequences, etc) and apply a set of settings (map size, firmware version, etc) appropriate to your FarmBot model. This will allow you to get started working with your FarmBot more quickly.
