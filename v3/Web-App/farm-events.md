# Event scheduling

It would not be convenient for you to manually initiate your sequences every time you want them to execute. This is where event scheduling comes in to help.

If you've ever used a calendar application before, you'll feel right at home with this. Simply choose the sequence you would like to execute, and schedule it to run on a one-off or repeating basis.

	<div class="callout-body"><p>Before your FarmBot can start executing the Farm Events you have created, you will need to share the data with the device. Press the <span class="fb-button fb-yellow">SYNC NOW</span> button in the upper right of the web app. If the sync was successful, the button will display <span class="fb-button fb-green">SYNCED</span>.</p>
