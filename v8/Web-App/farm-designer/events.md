It would not be convenient for you to manually initiate sequences every time you want them to execute. This is where **events** come in to help. If you've ever used a calendar application before, you'll feel right at home with this. Let's get started

# Creating events

Navigate to the events panel on the farm designer page and press the <span class="fb-button fb-yellow"><i class='fa fa-plus'></i></span> button to create a new **event**. Choose the **SEQUENCE OR REGIMEN** that you would like to execute and provide a **START** date and time. By default, the current date and current time + 3 minutes will be input into the date and time fields.

Optionally, sequence events can be set to **REPEAT EVERY** custom interval **UNTIL** a stop date and time.

{%
include callout.html
type="info"
title=""
content="Note that new events must be scheduled at least one minute into the future."
%}

Press the <span class="fb-button fb-green">SAVE</span> button to save the event. The event will now show up in the agenda.

# Editing events

To edit an event, hover over an event in the agenda view and press the <i class='fa fa-edit'></i> icon. Make the desired changes and press <span class="fb-button fb-green">SAVE</span>.
