The **WEBCAM FEEDS** section of the controls panel allows you to monitor your FarmBot from a distance with the use of an external camera system such as a Nest brand home security camera. Using a single camera, you could monitor the entire FarmBot bed while controlling it remotely, or, you could set up multiple webcams at different angles for viewing plants, etc.

If you see a web browser error after adding a webcam feed, there is unfortunately nothing FarmBot can do to fix the problem. Please contact your webcam's customer support to see if the security policy for embedding feeds into other sites can be changed."

# Viewing webcam feeds
The webcam feed area will display one webcam feed at a time. If you have added multiple webcam feeds, you can cycle through them using the `PREV` and `NEXT` buttons on the left and right sides of the widget.
