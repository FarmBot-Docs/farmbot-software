# Viewing photos
The carousel at the top of the panel allows you to view all of the photos in your FarmBot account. Photos are displayed in reverse chronological order, so the most recent photo you've taken always shows up first.

To take a photo, press the <span class="fb-button fb-green">take photo</span> button. Once FarmBot takes the photo, it will upload it to the web app along with the coordinates of where the photo was taken, as well as the date and time.

Once you have taken multiple photos, use the `PREV` and `NEXT` buttons to navigate through your images. To delete a photo, press the <span class="fb-button fb-red">delete photo</span> button.
