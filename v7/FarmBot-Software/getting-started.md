If you just finished your FarmBot hardware assembly, you should be ready to set up FarmBot's software. We suggest proceeding in the following order:

1. Create a web application account at [my.farm.bot](https://my.farm.bot).
2. [Install FarmBot OS](../FarmBot OS/farmbot-os.md) and [configure FarmBot](../FarmBot OS/farmbot-os/configurator.md) to connect to your home WiFi network and your web application account.
3. Verify that manual movements are successful throughout your FarmBot's working area using the [manual Controls](../The FarmBot Web App/controls.md).
4. [Calibrate](../Extras/calibration-and-homing.md) the device.
5. Adjust [Device parameters](../Web App/device.md) as desired and/or needed.
6. Add [Tools and Tool Slots](../The FarmBot Web App/farm-designer/tools.md).
7. Create and test [Sequences](../The FarmBot Web App/sequences.md) for mounting and dismounting tools.
8. Add plants to the [Farm Designer](../The FarmBot Web App/farm-designer.md).
9. Create Sequences to use the Tools on the Plants (ex: planting a seed, watering).
10. Create [Regimens](../The FarmBot Web App/regimens.md) to take care of a plant throughout its entire life.
11. Schedule [Events](../The FarmBot Web App/farm-designer/events.md) to run your Sequences and Regimens.

Extras: Add a [webcam feed](doc:controls#section-webcam-feeds), define [peripherals](doc:controls#section-peripherals) for easy manual operation.
