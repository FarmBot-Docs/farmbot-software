You generally will not need to manually control FarmBot, but in case you want to show off to your friends, you can do so from the **controls** page. Here, you'll find widgets for [movement](../The FarmBot Web App/controls/move.md), [peripheral control](../The FarmBot Web App/controls/peripherals.md), [watching a livestream of your FarmBot](../The FarmBot Web App/controls/webcam-feeds.md), and [reading sensors](../The FarmBot Web App/controls/sensors.md).
