The **WEBCAM FEEDS** widget allows you to monitor your FarmBot from a distance with the use of an external camera system such as a Nest brand home security camera. Using a single camera, you could monitor the entire FarmBot bed while controlling it remotely, or, you could set up multiple webcams at different angles for viewing plants, etc.
