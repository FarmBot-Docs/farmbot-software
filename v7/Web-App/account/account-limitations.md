|Resource                      |Limit                         |Notes                         |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
|Devices                       |1                             |While you technically *can* pair multiple devices to one account, we do not officially support this and it may result in unexpected behavior.
|Points (Plants, Weeds, Tool Slots)|1,000                         |We expect to offer increased limits with paid plans in the future.

|Logs (stored)                 |1,000                         |We expect to offer increased limits with paid plans in the future.
