To take a photo, press the <span class="fb-button fb-green">take photo</span> button. Once FarmBot takes the photo, it will upload it to the web app along with the coordinates of where the photo was taken, as well as the date and time.

Once you have taken multiple photos, use the `PREV` and `NEXT` buttons to navigate through your images. To delete a photo, press the <span class="fb-button fb-red">delete photo</span> button.
